	volume = {7240},
	abstract = {Much research has gone into developing methods for enhancing the contrast of displayed 3D scenes. In the current study, we investigated the perceptual impact of an algorithm recently proposed by Ritschel et al. that provides a general technique for enhancing the perceived contrast in synthesized scenes. Their algorithm extends traditional image-based Unsharp Masking to a 3D scene, achieving a scene-coherent enhancement. We conducted a standardized perceptual experiment to test the proposition that a 3D unsharp enhanced scene was superior to the original scene in terms of perceived contrast and preference. Furthermore, the impact of different settings of the algorithm’s main parameters enhancement-strength (λ) and gradient size (σ) were studied in order to provide an estimate of a reasonable parameter space for the method. All participants preferred a clearly visible enhancement over the original, non-enhanced scenes and the setting for objectionable enhancement was far above the preferred settings. The effect of the gradient size σ was negligible. The general pattern found for the parameters provides a useful guideline for designers when making use of 3D Unsharp Masking: as a rule of thumb they can easily determine the strength for which they start to perceive an enhancement and use twice this value for a good effect. Since the value for objectionable results was twice as large again, artifacts should not impose restrictions on the applicability of this rule.},

	abstract = {The glare illusion is commonly used in CG rendering, especially in game engines, to achieve a higher brightness than that of the maximum luminance of a display. In this work, we measure the perceived luminance of the glare illusion in a psychophysical experiment. To evoke the illusion, an image is convolved with either a point spread function (PSF) of the eye or a Gaussian kernel. It is found that 1) the Gaussian kernel evokes an illusion of the same or higher strength than that produced by the PSF while being computationally much less expensive, 2) the glare illusion can raise the perceived luminance by 20 -- 35\%, 3) some convolution kernels can produce undesirable Mach-band effects and thereby reduce the brightness boost of the glare illusion. The reported results have practical implications for glare rendering in computer graphics.},

The model is formulated in terms of an abstract dynamics for the activations of features, their binding into object entities, semantic categorization as well as related memories and appropriate reactions. The dynamical variables interact in a connectionist network which is shown to be adaptable to a variety of experimental paradigms. We find that selective attention can be modeled by means of inhibitory processes and by a threshold dynamics. The model is applied to the problem of disambiguating a number of theories for negative priming, an effect that is studied in connection to selective attention.},
